# Stackoverflow-2022-Salary-Prediction-with-LightGBM
Welcome to the "Stackoverflow 2022 Salary Prediction" repository! In this project, we aim to predict the salaries of Stackoverflow users for the year 2022 using a popular and powerful machine learning model called LightGBM.

# Project Overview:
Stackoverflow, the largest online community for developers, conducts an annual survey to gather valuable insights about developers' preferences, habits, and, most importantly, their salaries. The 2022 survey dataset contains a wealth of information about developers, including their age, education, coding experience, programming languages used, and many more factors that could potentially influence their salary.

# Goal:
The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate developers' salaries based on the features provided in the Stackoverflow 2022 survey dataset. By using LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework that excels in handling large datasets and providing fast, accurate predictions, we aim to achieve high performance and make precise salary predictions.

# Files Included:

Data: We have included the Stackoverflow 2022 survey dataset (survey_2022.csv) used for training and evaluating the model. This dataset contains both input features and target variable (salary) for a subset of Stackoverflow users who participated in the survey.

### Notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that walk you through the entire data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation process. The notebooks are named accordingly to provide a clear understanding of the steps involved.

### Models: After training, the best LightGBM model is saved in this directory for easy retrieval and future use.

### Documentation: A comprehensive guide is included, explaining the key concepts and steps followed in the project. This documentation will help you understand the model's architecture, parameter tuning, and evaluation metrics.

# Getting Started:
To get started with this project, simply clone this repository and explore the Jupyter notebooks to follow along with the analysis and model building process. Additionally, make sure you have the required libraries and dependencies installed to execute the code seamlessly.
